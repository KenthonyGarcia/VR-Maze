# VR-Maze
The virtual reality maze introduces traps and objectives that would hinder the user's progress. Users are forced to problem-solve in order to avoid traps and fulfill the objectives that are required to complete the maze. Each maze within the game has a different theme along with unique traps that would provide challenges that users would find entertaining as well as intellectually engaging.
