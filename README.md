# VR-Maze
The virtual reality maze introduces traps and objectives that would hinder the user's progress. Users are forced to problem-solve in order to avoid traps and fulfill the objectives that are required to complete the maze. Each maze within the game has a different theme along with unique traps that would provide challenges that users would find entertaining as well as intellectually engaging. A demo of the project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/aEnxZzfUeLU). The research report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Of4MsiFaX6Y21rzn3DJmGVQM5IIl05gq?usp=sharing).

## Run

If using an Oculus headset, connect the Oculus to the computer and press the run button. If using mouse and keyboard, enable the **XR Device Simulator** in the Hiearchy by clicking the checkbox in the Inspector before clicking the run button. The device simulator is by default inactive in all of the mazes. For the Ice maze, it does not exist in the hiearchy so it must be added.
